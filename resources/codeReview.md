# Week 7: A Workshop on Code Review and Assessment 

Date: October 23rd, 2020
(See [Connex]( https://connex.csc.uvic.ca/portal/site/emse2020) for link to Zoom, you need to use your UVic ID to access Connex)

## Lecture Objectives
- Learn about code assessment techniques that are used in industry to improve code quality
- Learn about empirical studies that have increased our understanding of code review and assessment techniques and tools that are applicable to industry
- Discuss how empirical studies may be limited and what we can do about it
- Learn how to do code reviews, how they can improve code quality and how to discuss/promote code reviews on the job or in job interviews

## Guests
- Jorge Aranda, Workday
- Chris Bird, Microsoft Research
- Michaela Greiler, Code Review Consultant
- Brian Houck, Microsoft
- Ali Mesbah, UBC

## Class Activity

For this class activity, Michaela Greiler has generously shared with us an exercise she uses in industry to train developers how to conduct effective code reviews (see https://www.michaelagreiler.com/).  
For this activity: 
- Individually, spend 10 mins reviewing the (to be) supplied source code. 
- In small breakout groups, refer to Dr. Greiler's checklist (this will be provided after the code review phase).  
- Which points covered in the checklist did you use?  Which parts did you not think about?  
- How would the checklist help in a future code review you might do on the job? 
- What kinds of training would you need to follow all of the guidelines in this checklist? Do you feel prepared to do a code review?
- If you were asked about code review in a job interview now that you've seen this checklist, would it change how you answer?

## Preclass Homework

Write a blogpost on the above assigned materials in advance of the lecture 
(to be completed by 6pm the day before the workshop --> Thursday).


Your blogpost should synthesize information from all of the assigned pre workshop materials and it
should include at most one discussion question per assigned reading/video/podcast. 
Copy these questions to the relevant Slack channel and like other questions you think should be asked of our guests (we can't ask all of them!). 
The course staff will curate/group them on Thursday evening. 
You may (and are encouraged to) update your blogpost after the workshop (but in a separate section of the post). 
The final version of your blogpost (if you improve it) is due by the following Monday at 6pm.
